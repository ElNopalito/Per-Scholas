# Per-Scholas

This repository contains notes from Per Scholas Software Engineering Cohort Cycle #13. These notes contain front-end & back-end development tools and application. These applications include HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Node.js/MongoDB/Postman/React.

Notes are annotated using //! and it is recommended to download the 'Better Comments' ext on VScode as it makes all comments bright red and will increase visibility.

Some code will be commented out to prevent inteference from redundancy while still being able to keep and refer back to.
