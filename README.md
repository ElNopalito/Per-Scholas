# Per-Scholas

Hey, glad you could stop by! This is a compilation of notes from my Per Scholas Software Engingeering bootcamp course. In this repo you'll find a variety of folders and files that contain HTML, CSS, Javascript notes.

I usually annotate using //! and would recommend you download the 'Better Comments' ext on VScode as it makes all my comments bright red so you can't miss them.
