# Per-Scholas

Hey, glad you could stop by! This is a compilation of notes from my Per Scholas Software Engingeering bootcamp course. In this repo you'll find a variety of folders and files that contain HTML, CSS, Javascript notes.

I usually annotate using //! and would recommend you download the 'Better Comments' ext on VScode as it makes all my comments bright red so you can't miss them. 

If you choose to follow along with my code, you'll notice that a lot of my code is commented out with '//'. This is so that I can keep them for examples for later but they would interfere with other code examples. If you'd like, just highlight which code you'd like to see in action and press ctrl+/ to un-comment.
